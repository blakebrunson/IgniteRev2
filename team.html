		<h3>Andra Scortzaru – Lead Organizer</h3>
		<p>Hey Everyone! My name is Andra Scortzaru and I am so excited to bring Ignite Talks to VT! I grew up in VT after having arrived here as a refugee from Romania when I was three. In high school my parents and I moved to the West Coast and I bounced around between Portland and Seattle for about 16 years. I then took a stint in Austin, TX and Dublin, Ireland to name a few and now here I am back in BTV!
		<br>
		<br>
		During my time on the West Coast I would regularly attend Ignite Talk Events and found the stories I would hear to be compelling and at times even humorous. I’m excited to be a part of story-telling in Burlington and hope that you all enjoy Ignite Talks as much as I do.</p>

		<h3>Christa Anderson – Co-Organizer, Emcee</h3>
		<p>My name is Christa Anderson and I am a Vermonter born and raised. At my roots I have loved volunteering in the community and getting involved. My background is in design and business looking at how design and art can bring people together and change the way we think, work and live.
		<br>
		<br>
		I was passionate about starting Ignite here to ensure a stage existed for people to share new ideas and perspectives. Opening eyes and minds to the world around us through educating, advocating, enlightening and empowering each other ideally to engender a deeper understand of one another and the world around us.</p>
